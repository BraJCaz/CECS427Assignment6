# Objective
- This assignment requires us to understand cascade effects because the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Suseptible (SIRS) model will create a program to validate whether a set of selected initiated triggers can complete a cascade.
- Subsequently, we will develop a simulation to test out COVID-19 using the SIRS model within a random directed graph.
- Additionally, it extends the model to the to simulate the impacts of shelter-in-place measures and vaccinations.
# Requirements 
- This is the command to execute the Pyhton script called dynamic_population.py to simulate the spread of a phenomenon (e.g. a cascade or a pandemic) across a network.
- This simulation will take account of various parameters such as the initiator, the spreading threshold, lifespan,
